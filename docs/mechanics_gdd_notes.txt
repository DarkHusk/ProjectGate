? - to be disscused/tried while implementing

player:
- can use firearms (rifles, shotguns, pistols)
- tactical menu (mb wrist menu) for managing npcs (and mb some aditional mechnics suitable for tactical mode. airstrike?)
- ability to cast skills(probably option for different classes/skill types), also a way to choose skill (gestures?, shortcuts?, wheel menu?)
- gathering of experience for killing mobs/completing objectives (portion of expirience is kept beetween "loops" for skill tree upgrades/modifiers)



NPCs:
- ability to act independently from the player (choosing to use support skills, trying to help finish the objective etc.)
- AI's decisions should be heavily influenced by player orders (focusing target, supporting, defending target/area, pushing etc.)
- ? posibly give characters their own character traits (like some characters prefering support role and they would focuse more on supporting the player?)
- posibility to choose nps's skills before mision (probably should influence nps decision making if we drop character traits idea,
	so for example nps with lots of supporting skills should focus on supporting the player, npcs with lots of AOE offensive skills focus on clearing etc)




world/maps:
- should be generated randomly each time (we could probably use some premade structures with randomized terrain for that, mainly so
	we can assure stuff like places to hide behind, ways to flank and so on)
- main map objective will be securing the portal (if we have time mb some other mission types) by:
	* pushing towards it, while defeating enemies
	* ? blocking the portal by interacting with it (it would stop new enemies waves emerging from the portal)
	* clearing the surrounding area?/defending the portal from remaining enemies
- after each mission player would come back to base to resupply/change their equipment (?we would probably need to make some balance changes to this
	like limiting some resources, give resuply some type of cost so players are more motivated to preserve resources/play missions well)
- each mission would be more difficult (probably spawning tougher enemies variants etc.)(we could also try similar system that RimWorld has
	where raids have certain amount of points to spend on choosing enemies so players that are richer will get stronger raids. in our case
	points would be calculated using mission number, how well player does in the mission etc)
- ? boss missions from time to time



enemies:
- enemies inspired by fantasy (Yes we can use HoMM units if we want)
- different enemy types with their own behaviour:
	* weak enemies working in large groups/rushing the player using their numbers (possibly cooperate like Kobolds?)
	* strong "tank" monsters
	* ranged and suport enemies
	* enemies that prefer flanking etc.
- giving enemies some kind of scoring/points system to determine the amount of exp they give (probably also to calculate RimWorld inspired points an more)
